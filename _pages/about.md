Currently, I am a UW eScience postdoctoral fellow having the pleasure of working with [Dr. William Noble](https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/). Before that, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University where I was advised by [Dr. Mona Singh](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mona/).

My research interests lie in the confluence of artificial intelligence, statistics and biology and are focused on developing novel methods to tackle the significant challenges of “big data” genomics. I have been employing network-based algorithms and machine learning models to try to decipher the molecular underpinnings of complex diseases such as cancer. Recently, I have used diffusion kernels to try to understand the role of inter-chromosomal interactions during heart development. Broadly speaking my research interests include:
* detecting disease-causing variant, especially those mutated at low frequency
* building machine learning models capable of capturing dysregulated molecular pathways
* predicting how changes in 3D genome conformation induce changes to cell function
* data integration via manifold alignment
